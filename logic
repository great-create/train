1. You are to design a counter that produces the following count sequence:
1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ··· , 15, 15, ··· , 1, 2, 2, etc.
that is, it produces one 1, two 2’s, three 3’s, and so on, up to fifteen 15’s, after which it starts back with one 1,
two 2’s, etc.
You have available a catalog of up counters and down counters, each with data inputs, load, enable, and clear
inputs, and true and complemented form of each output. Assume that all counter inputs are active high.
Build a counter that realizes the above sequence by using only two counters from the catalog and no more
than 10 logic gates (or, nand, nor, and, inverter). (Note: A solution is possible with significantly less than 10
logic gates.) Your answer should include a clear and neat circuit diagram, and an explanation of how your
design works.

2. Consider a finite state machine with n states. Suppose a periodic sequence of input symbols is applied to the
FSM. That is, a sequence of inputs of the form
(X1 ,X2 , ··· ,Xk ), (X1 ,X2 , ··· ,Xk ), ··· , (X1 ,X2 , ··· ,Xk ) ···
is applied to the FSM starting in some state.
a. Prove that the sequence of outputs produced will eventually be periodic.
b. Using the result of part a. show whether or not an FSM with a single bit input X, and a single bit output
Z, can be constructed that will produce an output Z = 1 whenever the input sequence has r(r + 1)/2 1’s
for r =1, 2, 3,..., (i.e. 1, 3, 6, 10,... 1’s). An example input-output behavior of the FSM to be designed is
as follows:
Input = 0011001100110
Output = 0010001000010

3. Construct a state diagram of a machine with one input, and 10 (or fewer) states which produces an output z
= 1 whenever the last string of five inputs contains exactly 3 1s and the string starts with 2 1s. After each
string which starts with 2 1s, analysis of the next string will not start until the end this string five, whether it
produces a 1 or not. For example, the input 11011010 produces an output of 00000000, whereas the input
10011010 produces 00000001.

4. The following figure shows a rotating disk with two optical sensors, A, and B, that are positioned 90
degrees apart. Half of the disc is white and the other half is black. A sensor generates a logic 0 when the
black portion of the disk is underneath, otherwise it generates a logic 1.

You are to design a Mealy type and a Moore type state machine that will determine the direction of rotation
of the disk. The circuit output should be 0 if it is rotating clockwise, and 1 otherwise. Your answer should
include the state diagrams, and explanation of the solution. Assume that the surface is sampled more than
four times per revolution of the disk.


5. You have available a catalog of parts including standard logic gates (and, nand, or, xor, inverter, etc.), each
with a delay of 2ns, and up as well down counters with standard features such as enable, parallel load,
synchronous clear, etc. You are to design a state machine that divides a 50 MHz clock by 3/2. In other words,
the input is a 50MHz clock and the output is a 33.33 MHz clock. Assume a 50% duty cycle of the input clock.
This means that for 1/2 the period it is high and for the remaining half of a period it is low.
Your solution should include a clear, neat circuit diagram, and timing waveforms of the input and output
signals showing that the circuit realizes the specification. (Hint: Dividing the clock frequency by 3/2 means
increasing its period by 3/2. This can be accomplished by decreasing its period by a factor of 2 and then
increasing it by a factor of 3. Note: the duty cycle of the output clock need not be 50%)
